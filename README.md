#  NLP + ML Project 
*Language Detection Model*  
Machine Learning & NLP Project  
- Built a language detection model inspired by Google Translate using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
- Preprocessed and cleaned multilingual datasets, leveraging NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization.  
- Applied Naive Bayes classifier with NLP tools, including CountVectorizer, to develop and train a model for accurate language identification.  
- Executed a full project pipeline: data preparation, model design, training, and evaluation, ensuring robust performance in real-time language detection.  
- Tested the model for real-world applications, mimicking functionalities of advanced language detection systems.  
- Tools & Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, NLP (CountVectorizer), Naive Bayes, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib. 
# DataScience1
Objective:
To uncover actionable insights and predictive trends in the food and restaurant sector using Zomato's dataset, enhancing decision-making for consumers and businesses alike.

üõ†Ô∏è Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Acquired and cleaned a comprehensive Zomato dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and SQL.
- Standardized missing data, encoded categorical variables, and normalized features to prep for analysis and modeling.
üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted in-depth EDA to identify high-rated cuisines, pricing patterns, and geographic concentration of restaurants.
- Detected outliers and unusual rating distributions using statistical plots and logical checks.
üìà Data Visualization
- Created compelling visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to highlight trends like delivery frequency, cost vs rating, and cuisine popularity.
- Mapped restaurant density across cities with heatmaps to showcase regional preferences.
