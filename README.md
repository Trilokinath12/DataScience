# DataScience NLP + ML Project 
*Language Detection Model*  
Machine Learning & NLP Project  
- Built a language detection model inspired by Google Translate using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
- Preprocessed and cleaned multilingual datasets, leveraging NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn for data analysis and visualization.  
- Applied Naive Bayes classifier with NLP tools, including CountVectorizer, to develop and train a model for accurate language identification.  
- Executed a full project pipeline: data preparation, model design, training, and evaluation, ensuring robust performance in real-time language detection.  
- Tested the model for real-world applications, mimicking functionalities of advanced language detection systems.  
- Tools & Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, NLP (CountVectorizer), Naive Bayes, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
