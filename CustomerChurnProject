### The Story: Saving Telco Inc. from Customer Churn

*Setting the Scene*: Telco Inc. is losing customers, and each departure costs them revenue and reputation. The leadership hands you a dataset containing customer details—tenure, monthly charges, contract types, and whether they churned. Your mission is to analyze this data, uncover patterns, and build a predictive system to identify at-risk customers so the company can offer targeted retention strategies, like discounts or personalized support. The journey unfolds in a Jupyter Notebook, where each step is a chapter in solving this business puzzle.

### Chapter 1: Exploring the Customer Landscape (Week 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis)
*What I Did*: I began by loading the Telco Customer Churn dataset into a pandas DataFrame, like opening a treasure chest of customer information. I checked for missing values, finding that TotalCharges had some non-numeric entries, which I converted to numbers and filled with the median value to keep the data clean. Next, I computed summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical features like tenure, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges. I visualized their distributions using histograms with KDE curves, created a correlation heatmap to spot relationships, and plotted churn rates across contract types using a count plot.

*Significance*: This step was like mapping the terrain of Telco Inc.’s customer base. The histograms revealed that tenure had a bimodal distribution—some customers were brand new, others long-term—hinting at different loyalty patterns. The correlation heatmap showed a strong link between tenure and total charges, suggesting that longer-tenured customers rack up higher bills. The count plot was a revelation: customers on month-to-month contracts were far more likely to churn than those on two-year contracts. These insights gave Telco Inc. a starting point to understand why customers might leave, setting the stage for deeper analysis.

*Real-World Impact*: For Telco Inc., this EDA is like a customer satisfaction survey on steroids. It highlights which customer groups (e.g., short-term contract holders) are at risk, helping the marketing team focus their retention efforts.

### Chapter 2: Testing Hypotheses with Statistics (Week 6 - Probability and Statistical Testing)
*What I Did*: I dug deeper into the contract type insight from EDA by performing a t-test to compare the average tenure of customers with month-to-month versus two-year contracts. I also simulated a normal distribution for tenure using NumPy to understand its probabilistic behavior, visualizing it with a histogram.

*Significance*: The t-test was like interrogating the data to confirm suspicions. With a low p-value (< 0.05), it proved that month-to-month customers have significantly shorter tenures, making them more likely to churn. The simulated distribution helped me understand tenure’s variability, ensuring I wasn’t making assumptions based on outliers. These statistical tools validated my EDA findings with rigor, ensuring Telco Inc.’s decisions would be data-driven.

*Real-World Impact*: This step is like a quality check for Telco Inc.’s hypotheses. Confirming that month-to-month customers are less loyal allows the company to prioritize long-term contract promotions, backed by solid evidence.

### Chapter 3: Preparing the Data for Prediction (Preprocessing)
*What I Did*: Before building predictive models, I prepared the data by encoding categorical variables (e.g., contract types) into numbers using LabelEncoder and scaling numerical features like tenure and charges with StandardScaler. I split the data into training and test sets (80-20 split) and converted them to PyTorch tensors for later deep learning tasks, ensuring compatibility with both scikit-learn and PyTorch.

*Significance*: This was like cleaning and organizing a toolbox before starting a big project. Encoding and scaling ensured all features were on the same playing field, preventing biases in model training. The train-test split mimicked real-world scenarios where predictions are made on unseen data, and the PyTorch tensors set the stage for advanced deep learning models.

*Real-World Impact*: For Telco Inc., clean and standardized data means the predictive models will be fair and reliable, ensuring retention strategies target the right customers.

### Chapter 4: Building a Baseline with Machine Learning (Week 7 - Introduction to Machine Learning)
*What I Did*: I built a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to predict churn, training it on the preprocessed data. I evaluated its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC, printing the results to assess its effectiveness.

*Significance*: Logistic regression was my first attempt at solving the churn mystery, like using a simple magnifying glass to spot clues. It provided a baseline, achieving decent accuracy but moderate recall, indicating it missed some at-risk customers. The ROC AUC score showed how well the model distinguished churners from non-churners, giving me a benchmark to improve upon.

*Real-World Impact*: For Telco Inc., this baseline model is a quick way to identify some at-risk customers, allowing the customer service team to start reaching out, even if it’s not perfect yet.

### Chapter 5: Powering Up with Advanced Machine Learning (Weeks 8-9 - Model Evaluation and Advanced Algorithms)
*What I Did*: I upgraded to a Random Forest classifier, a more powerful tool, and used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters like n_estimators and max_depth. I evaluated the best model using the same metrics, comparing it to the logistic regression baseline.

*Significance*: Random Forest was like switching to a high-tech radar. Its ensemble approach captured complex patterns in the data, improving ROC AUC and recall compared to logistic regression. Hyperparameter tuning ensured the model was optimized, like fine-tuning a car engine for peak performance. This step showed I could go beyond simple models to deliver better predictions.

*Real-World Impact*: Telco Inc. now has a more accurate tool to pinpoint at-risk customers, enabling targeted retention campaigns with higher success rates.

### Chapter 6: Segmenting Customers with Unsupervised Learning (Week 10 - Clustering and Unsupervised Learning)
*What I Did*: I applied K-means clustering to segment customers into three groups based on their features, then used PCA to reduce the data to two dimensions for visualization. I plotted the clusters and summarized their average tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.

*Significance*: Clustering was like grouping Telco Inc.’s customers into tribes based on their behavior. The PCA visualization revealed distinct segments—e.g., long-term high-spenders versus short-term low-spenders. The cluster summaries showed which groups were more likely to churn, providing actionable insights beyond prediction.

*Real-World Impact*: Telco Inc. can use these segments to tailor marketing strategies, like offering loyalty perks to high-value customers or discounts to short-term ones, boosting retention.

### Chapter 7: Diving into Deep Learning with PyTorch (Week 11 - Introduction to Deep Learning)
*What I Did*: I built a neural network using PyTorch, defining a ChurnNN class with three layers (64, 32, 1 neurons) and ReLU/sigmoid activations. I trained it using BCELoss and the Adam optimizer, leveraging a DataLoader for batch processing. I evaluated its performance with the same metrics and plotted the training loss curve.

*Significance*: This was like upgrading from a radar to a satellite. The neural network learned complex, non-linear patterns in the data, offering a modern approach to churn prediction. The training loss plot showed how the model improved over time, and its performance was comparable to Random Forest, proving its potential. Using PyTorch showcased my ability to work with cutting-edge deep learning frameworks.

*Real-World Impact*: For Telco Inc., the neural network provides a sophisticated tool for churn prediction, potentially capturing subtle patterns missed by traditional models, enhancing retention efforts.

### Chapter 9: Listening to Customers with NLP (Week 13 - NLP)
*What I Did*: Since the dataset lacked text data, I simulated customer comments (e.g., “Great service!” for non-churners, “Poor service, likely to churn.” for churners). I used NLTK’s VADER to perform sentiment analysis, creating a new Sentiment feature. I retrained the Random Forest model with this feature and evaluated its performance.

*Significance*: This step was like eavesdropping on customer feedback. The sentiment feature added a new dimension to the model, slightly improving performance by capturing customer emotions. It showed my ability to integrate NLP into a structured data problem, making the model more holistic.

*Real-World Impact*: For Telco Inc., incorporating customer feedback (even simulated) means the model reflects real-world sentiments, allowing the company to address dissatisfaction proactively.
